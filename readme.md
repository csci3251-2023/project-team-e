# Introduction

We will start by creating issues for each task, and using a project board to track our progress. Then, we will set up this README file to provide an overview of our project and the tasks we are undertaking. After that, we will write a simple C code and set up a GitHub Action with a workflow to run the code automatically. We will add a status badge to our repository in task five to display the status of our workflow. Additionally, we will create a showcase our team member and register our repository.
